This quote from Terry A. Davis, the creator of TempleOS,
has stuck with me for a while. It's kind of my life
motto — I believe that keeping things simple is the key
to clarity and really focusing on what matters. It's a
principle I try to live by, both in my work and in everyday life.

Hi, my name is Lucas, and I am a software
developer from Luxembourg. My interests revolve around retro computing, operating systems, and emulators. There's something fascinating about vintage hardware and software—the creative solutions people came up with to overcome limitations. I spend much of my time exploring these old systems, reviving them, and even building emulators to help preserve them. Emulators allow me to run ancient operating systems and software on modern machines, giving them a second life in the digital age.

When I'm not working on emulators or learning about retro systems, I'm likely surrounded by my cats. They've been my constant companions during my coding sessions, adding a bit of fun and relaxation to the process. Plus, they seem to have a magical way of keeping me focused when things get tricky!

This website is my personal space to share projects, thoughts, and musings on retro computing, operating systems, emulators, and sometimes, a cat-related distraction. I hope to inspire others who share these interests to dive deeper into the world of vintage tech and the magic behind recreating it.
