# Chippy-8: A Chip 8 Emulator in C

Chippy-8 is a lightweight Chip 8 emulator built with C and SDL2, designed to run classic Chip 8 games on modern systems. This project showcases my skills in **C programming**, **SDL2**, and **system-level development**.

## Overview

Chip 8 is an interpreted programming language used on early home computers in the 1970s. This emulator allows you to run games originally designed for Chip 8-compatible systems on modern devices.

The goal of this project was to create an efficient and portable emulator in C, leveraging **SDL2** for rendering and input handling. It highlights my ability to work with low-level programming and graphics libraries.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Graphics Library**: SDL2 for rendering and user input
- **CPU Emulation**: Implements the Chip 8 instruction set, including timers and sound support.
- **ROM Loading**: Supports loading and running ROM files that contain Chip 8 programs (e.g., games).
- **Optimizations**: Implemented efficient rendering loops and memory management to ensure smooth performance.

This project was a great way to deepen my knowledge of low-level programming, system architecture, and graphics handling.

## Features

- **Full Chip 8 Support**: Capable of running classic Chip 8 games.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with SDL2 for compatibility across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- **Optimized Performance**: Efficient and lightweight design suitable for low-resource environments.
- **Keyboard Input**: Emulates keyboard interaction for Chip 8 games.

The project demonstrates my proficiency in **C programming**, **SDL2**, and **performance optimization**.

## How to Run

To get Chippy-8 up and running, please refer to the full instructions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucaszebrowsky/Chippy-8). There, you'll find the steps to install, build, and run the emulator on different platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
